# NFT Based Patient Health Records

A simple application to allow users to upload their medical records and get them converted to NFTs

These NFTs can then be shared with organizations via their Token IDs

## Structure

The application is split into two halves, one for `users` and the other for `organizations`.

Users have their own set of pages, and organizations have their own set of pages, and a few pages are shared by them

## Routes

### Users:

- `/access-control`
- `/history`
- `/records`
- `/upload`

### Organizations:

- `/granted-records`
- `/request-access`

### Common Routes:

- `/dashboard`
- `/notifications`
- `/profile`
- `/role-select`
- `/sign-in`
- `/sign-up`
- `/view/[token_id]`

## API Routes

API Routes in this application were created using **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)** to provide end-to-end type safety.

Queries and Mutations are made with the help of **[React Query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)**

There are primarily 5 API routes within this application:

- `/access-requests`
- `/history`
- `/medical-records`
- `/notifications`
- `/users`

Unfortunately, testing is not available for these routes since they use Clerk Auth's backend functionality to verify user's User IDs (autogenerated by Clerk).

The only way to test is to run the application in a development environment, and test each function at their respectively used pages
